1. The root file is primer.tex .

2. Before compilation, first delete all *.toc 
   files (auxiliary files for creating Table of Contents),
   and all *.mtc* files (auxiliary files for 
   creating Mini Table of Contents in each Chapter). 
   Else they can cause strange LaTeX compilation errors.

3. After performing Step 2, primer.pdf can be compiled 
   from the following:

     xelatex primer
     xelatex primer
     bibtex primer
     xelatex primer
     xelatex primer

   Note that we use xelatex instead of pdflatex, 
   as some of the source files contain Unicode characters.
   The above commands are tested with the 
   TeX Live 2023 Distribution.
   
4. On indices: At present, the indices are generated 
   using the 'multind' package and
that entails running 'makeindex' multiple times, 
   one for each list of indices.
For the translation, one may consider switching 
   to 'imakeidx' package (or something similar),
which requires only one run of 'makeindex'. 
   If switching to 'imakeidx' is desired,
the \indexprologue command from the 'imakeidx' 
   package will be handy for inserting texts
between the index header and the index entries, 
   as needed in this Primer.
