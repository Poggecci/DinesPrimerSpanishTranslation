\begin{itemize}
\item The \sort{aim} of this \monograph\ is to contribute to a 
      methodology for analysing and describing domains.
  
\item The \sort{objectives} -- in the sense of `how is the aim
      achieved' -- is reflected in the structure and contents
      and the didactic approach of this \monograph.
\item The main elements of \ysfchg{our} approach -- along one
  concept-axis -- can be itemized: 
\begin{itemize}
\item There is the founding of our analysis \& description
      approach in providing a base \sort{philosophy},
      cf.\,Chapter\,\ref{chap2.tex.Philosophy}. 
\item There is the application of ideas of \sort{taxonomy} 
      to understand the possibly hierarchical structuring
      of domain phenomena respectively the understanding of properties
      of phenomena and relations between them.
\item There {are} the notions \sort{endurants} and \sort{perdurants} --
      with \sfsl{endurants}  \index{pdefind}{endurant} being the phenomena
\begynd
\pind that can be observed, or conceived and described, as \nyl a ``complete
      thing'' at no matter which given snapshot of time\pos{
      \cite[Vol.\,I, pg.\,656]{OED}}{},
\afslut
      and \sfsl{perdurants}  \index{pdefind}{perdurant} being the phenomena 
\begynd
\pind for which only a fragment exists\pos{}{\\} if we look at or
      touch them\pos{}{\\} at
      any given snapshot in time\pos{
      \cite[Vol.\,II, pg.\,1552]{OED}}{}.
\afslut
\item There is the introduction of base elements of
      \sort{calculi}  \index{pdefind}{calculi} for analysing and
      describing domains. \index{pdefind}{calculus!analysis}
\item There is the application of ideas of \sort{ontology} 
      to understand the possibly hierarchical structuring
      of these calculi.\index{pdefind}{ontology} 
\item And finally there is the notion of
      \index{pdefind}{transcendental deduction} \sort{transcendental
      deduction}, cf.\,Sect.\,\ref{sec:Transcendence}, for ``morphing''
      certain kinds of endurants into certain kinds of perdurants,
      Chapter \ref{chap6.tex.1}. 
\end{itemize}
\item Along another conceptual-axis the below are further  elements
        of our approach:
\begin{itemize}
\item We consider domain descriptions, requirements prescriptions and
      software design specifications to be \brcolor{mathematical}
      \index{pdefind}{mathematics} quantities.
\item And we consider them basically in the sense of
      \sort{recursive function theory}
      \index{pdefind}{recursive!function theory} \cite[Hartley Rogers,
      1952]{Rogers67} and 
      \sort{type theory}  \index{pdefind}{type!theory} \cite[Benjamin
      Pierce, 1997]{pierce1997}.

\subsection*{\bbcolor{An Emphasis}}\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{\bbcolor{An Emphasis}} 

\anemphasis{Domains exhibit endurants and perdurants. A domain model
  is therefore something that defines the \sfsl{nouns} (roughly speaking the
  endurants) and \sfsl{verbs} (roughly speaking the {perdurants}) -- and
  their combination -- of a
  \sfsl{language} spoken and used in writing by the practitioners of the domain. Not an
  instantiation of nouns, verbs and their combination,
  but all possible and sensible instantiations.}{}

\subsection*{\bbcolor{A Caveat}}\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{\bbcolor{A Caveat}}

Experienced \texttt{RSL} \cite{RSL} readers might observe our,
perhaps cavalier (offhand), use of  \texttt{RSL}. Perhaps, in some places, the 
syntax of  \texttt{RSL} clauses is not quite right. Our non-use of
\texttt{RSL}'s module (\texttt{Scheme}\ysfchg{, } \texttt{Class} and \texttt{Object})
constructs force \ysfchg{us } to declare \textsf{channel}s in the same way
\textsf{type}s, \textsf{value}s and \textsf{variable}s are introduced.
