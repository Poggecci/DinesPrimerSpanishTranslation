      as metaphysics.
\pos{\pind To explain that concept \ysfchg{we } quote from \wiki:}{}
\afslut

\sl ``Metaphysics is the branch of philosophy that studies the fundamental
nature of reality, the first principles of being, identity and change,
space and time, causality, necessity, and
possibility.%
\footnote{www.\-en\-cy\-clo\-pe\-di\-a.\-com/\-phi\-lo\-so\-phy-\-and-\-re\-li\-gion/\-phi\-lo\-so\-phy/\-phi\-lo\-so\-phy-\-terms-\-and-\-con\-cepts/\-me\-ta\-phy\-sics}
It includes 
questions about the nature of consciousness and the relationship
between mind and matter, between substance and attribute, and between
potentiality and actuality.\footnote{Metaphysics. American Heritage
  Dictionary of the English Language (5th ed.). 2011.} The word
``metaphysics'' comes from two 
Greek words that, together, literally mean ``after or behind or among
[the study of] the natural''. It has been suggested that the term might
have been coined by a first century editor who assembled various
small selections of Aristotle's works into the treatise we now know by
the name Metaphysics ($\mu\epsilon\tau\alpha$ $\tau\alpha$
$\phi\upsilon\sigma\iota\kappa\alpha$\dbeat{μετὰ τὰ φυσικά}, meta ta
  physika, \ysfchg{literally } 'after the 
Physics ', another of Aristotle's works) \cite{CohenSMarc2018}.

Metaphysics studies questions related to what it is for something to
exist and what types of existence there are. Metaphysics seeks to
answer, in an abstract and fully general manner, the
questions:\footnote{What is it (that is, whatever it is that there is)
  like? Hall, Ned (2012). "David Lewis's Metaphysics". In Edward
  N. Zalta (ed.). The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2012

Topics of metaphysical investigation include existence, objects and
their properties, space and time, cause and effect, and
possibility. Metaphysics is considered one of the four main branches
of philosophy, along with epistemology, logic, and ethics''\rm\

\mnewfoil

\begynd
\pind What can we say about these states\,?
\begynd
\pind First that these states accrue different, \nyl incommensurable predicates.
\pind How can we assure that\,!
\pind Only if the states stand in an asymmetric relation to one another.
\pind From this we can conclude \nyl that primary entities necessarily \nyl
      may exist in a number of states 
\pind each of which stand \nyl  in an asymmetric relation to
      \ysfchg{its }
      predecessor state.

\nbbbb{The Causality Principle}

\begynd
\pind But what is it that \sfsl{cause}\ysfchg{s } primary entities to undergo
      \sfsl{state changes}\,? \index{pconind}{state!change}%
\begynd
\pind Assertions about how a primary entity is at different times, \nyl
      such assertions must necessarily be logically independent.
\pind That follows from primary entities necessarily must accrue
      incommensurable predicates at different times.
\pind It is therefore logically impossible to conclude from how a
      primary entity is at one time to  how it is at another time.
\pind How, therefore, can assertions about a primary entity at
      different times be about the same entity\,?
\afslut
\afslut

\mnewfoil

\begynd
\pind We can therefore transcendentally deduce that \nyl
      there must be a \sfsl{special implication-%
      relationship} \nyl between assertions about how a primary entity
    \nyl is at different times.
\begynd
\pind Such a \sfsl{special implication-relationship} must depend on
      the \sfsl{empirical circumstances} under which the primary entity
      exists. 
\pind That is, we must deduce the conditions under which it is, at
      all, possible to consistently make statements about primary
      entities going from one state in which it accrues a specific
      predicate to another state in which it accrues a therefrom
      incommensurable predicate.
\pind There must be something in the empirical circumstances which
      implicates the state transition.
\mnewfoil
\pind If the \ysfchg{\dbeat{the} } empirical circumstances are \sfsl{stable} \nyl
      then there is nothing in these circumstances that imply entity changes.
\pind If the primary entity changes, then that assumes that there must
      have been a prior change in the circumstances -- with those
      changes having that consequence.\ \ldots\footnote{We skip some of
      S{\o}rlander's reasoning, \cite[Page\,162, lines 1--12]{kaisorlander2016}}\ 
\pind We name such a change of the circumstances \sfsl{a cause}.\index{pconind}{cause}
\pind And we conclude that every change of a primary entity must have
      a cause.
\pind We also conclude that \sfsl{equivalent causes} imply
      \sfsl{equivalent effects}.
\afslut

\begynd 
\pind It assumes logical implication.
\pind But it cannot be reduced to logical implication. 
\pind It is logically necessary that every primary entity -- and
      therefore every possible world -- is subject
      to the \sfsl{causality principle}.
\afslut
\pind In this way Kai S{\o}rlander transcendentally deduce\ysfchg{s } the

\nbbbb{Newton's Laws}

\begynd
\pind S{\o}rlander then shows how Newton's laws can be deduced.
\pind These laws, in summary, are:
\begin{itemize}
\item \sort{Newton's First Law:} \index{pconind}{Newton's Law!Number 1}  
    An entity at rest or moving at a constant speed in a straight
    line, will remain at rest or keep moving in a straight line at
    constant speed unless it is acted upon by a force.  
\item \sort{Newton's Second Law:} \index{pconind}{Newton's Law!Number 2}
     When an entity is acted upon by a force, the time rate of change of
     its momentum equals the force.  
\item \sort{Newton's Third Law:} \index{pconind}{Newton's Law!Number 3}
    To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction; or, the
    mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and
    directed to contrary entities.
\end{itemize}

\nbbb{Kinematics}\label{Kinematics}

\begynd
\pind Above we have deduced that primary entities are in both space
      and time.
\begynd
\pind They have \sfsl{extent}  in both space and time.
\pind That means that they may change with respect to their spatial
      properties: place and form.
\pind The change in place is the fundamental.
\pind A primary entity which changes place is said to be in
      \sfsl{movement}. \index{pconind}{movement}%
\pind A primary entity in {movement} must follow a certain geometric route.
\pind It must move a certain length of route in a certain interval of
      time, i.e., have a \sfsl{velocity:} speed and
      direction. \index{pconind}{velocity}% 
\pind A primary entity which changes velocity has an
      \sfsl{acceleration.} \index{pconind}{acceleration}%

      \sfsl{kinematics}. \index{pconind}{kinematics}% 
\afslut 
\afslut

\nbbb{Dynamics}\label{Dynamics}

\begynd
\pind When we, to the above, add that primary entities are in time, \nyl
      then they are subject to causality.
\begynd
\pind That means that we are entering the doctrine of the influence of
      \sfsl{force}s on primary entities.
\pind That is, \sfsl{dynamics}. \index{pconind}{dynamics}%
\pind Kinematics imply that an entity changes if it goes from being at
      rest to mov\ysfchg{ing}, \nyl or if it goes from moving to being at rest.
\pind An entity also changes if it goes from moving at one velocity to
      moving at a different velocity.
\pind We introduce the notion of \sfsl{momentum}. \index{pconind}{momentum}%
\pind An entity has \ysfchg{the } same momentum \ysfchg{ } at two
      times \ysfchg{if } it has the same
      velocity and acceleration.

\nbbb{Newton's First Law}

\begynd
\pind When we combine kinematics with causality
\begynd
\pind then we can deduce that if an entity changes momentum \nyl
      then there must be a cause in the circumstances \nyl which
      causally implies the change.
\pind We call that cause a \sfsl{force}. \index{pconind}{force}%
\pind The force must be proportional to the change in momentum.
\pind This implies that an entity which is not subject to an external
      force \nyl remains in the same momentum.
\pind This is \sort{The Law of Inertia}, \sort{Newton\ysfchg{'}s First Law.}

\nbbb{Newton's Second Law}

\begynd
\pind That a certain force is necessary \nyl in order to change an entity's  
      momentum \nyl must imply that such an entity must provide a
      certain \sfsl{resistance} \index{pconind}{resistance} against
      change of momentum.
\begynd
\pind It must have a \sfsl{mass}. \index{pconind}{mass}%
\pind From this it follows that the change of an entity's momentum
\begynd
\pind not only must be proportional to the applied force
\pind but also inversely proportional to that entity's mass.

\pind It must, it can only, be from primary entities.
\begynd
\pind Primary entities must be the source of the forces that influence
      other entities.
\pind Here we shall argue one such reason.
\pind The next section, on universal gravitation, presents a second reason.

\pind Primary entities may be in one \ysf{an}other's way.
\begynd
\pind Hence they may eventually collide.
\pind If a primary entity has a certain velocity \nyl
      it may collide with another primary entity crossing its way.
\pind In the mutual collision the two entities influence one another
      \nyl such that they change momentum.
\pind They influence each other with forces.
\pind Since \ysfchg{neither } of the two entities ha\ysfchg{s } any special position, i.e.,

     the source of forces  \nyl that affects one another\,?
\begynd
\pind We must dig deeper\,!
\pind How can primary entities have mass such that it requires force
      to change their momentum\,?
\pind Our answer is that the reason they have mass \nyl
      must be due to mutual influence between the primary objects themselves.
\pind It must be an influence which is oppositely directed to that \nyl
      which they expose on one another when they collide.
\pind Because this, in principle, applies to all primary entities, \nyl
