		  seems to be increasingly constrained 
		  in its mission to 
supply services which are continuous, costless and available in all 
directions, the telecommunications system seems to have no such
constraints and to be developing ever more rapidly in terms of 
inter-connectivity, falling costs and multi-directionality. It would
seem to be impossible to contemplate the future demand for transport
in isolation from the future demand for telecommunications and the
question of the optimal interaction between the two mobility modes. 
Reviews the benefits of the different forms of telecommunications and
virtual logistics. Investigates the implications for freight logistics
and the supply side of the transport industry. Suggests a way to
re-engineer the analytical framework.}\jfnote{Perhaps}"}
