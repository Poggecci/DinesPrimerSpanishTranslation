This is a report on the formal definition of the CafeOBJ algebraic language, which is a modern successor of the famous algebraic language OBJ. While the equational core of CafeOBJ is just a re-shaping of OBJ3, CafeOBJ
significantly extends OBJ3 by implementing several recent major developments in the area of algebraic specification, such as behavioural specification and rewriting logic.

The definition of the language parallels its logical semantics based on the so-called institutions which also provide a methodological framework for structuring the presentation of the basic constructs of the language and their
semantics.

This report presents all basic constructs of the language together with their semantics and addressing both the programming in-the-small and in-the-large levels, but also discusses proof systems and technologies, as well
as methodologies. Examples are provided all over the report as intuitive support for the definitions of the constructs and for illustrating proof techniques and methodologies}"}

document presents the semantics of CafeOBJ system and
		  language. 
CafeOBJ can be seen as a succesor of the
		  famous algebraic specification and programming
		  language OBJ 
but adding several new paradigms to the
traditional OBJ language, such as 
specification of concurrent systems,
		  object-orientation, 
and behavioural specification.  
CafeOBJ is a declarative language 
in the same way other OBJ-family
		  languages (OBJ, 
Eqlog, FOOPS, Maude) are. Therefore
		  the formal semantics 
of CafeOBJ follows the same
		  general principle: 

There is an underlying logic 
(i.e., institution) in which all basic
		  constructs/features of the language can be
		  rigorously explained.  

This intimate relationship between 
the language and its underlying
		  logic was called 
``logical programming'' by Goguen
		  and Meseguer. 
In providing the semantics for 
CafeOBJ we distinguish between four
		  levels of the language:  

\begin{verbatim}
    - programming in the small
    - programming in the large
    - programming in the huge
    - environment.
\end{verbatim} 

Programming ``in the small'' 
refers to collections of program
		  statements,
as obtained by flattening the individual
		  modules, 
programming ``in the large'' to the module
		  interconnection 
system, programming ``in the huge''
		  to the 
software system composition, 
and the environment to the set of tools
		  (including 
methodologies) supporting the process of
		  programming and specification building in
		  CafeOBJ. 
While programming in the small and in the
		  large 
require formal mathematical 
semantics, programming in the huge can be
		  approached semantically using some general
		  techniques 
developed for programming in the large,
		  the environment 
cannot (and should not) be given
		  formal 
semantics. However we devote a 
brief section to the latter because
		  this is an 
essential aspect of the CafeOBJ system
		  which should 
be understood in relationship to the
		  former levels. 
So we formulate the second principle
		  of our 
semantics: 

Provide an integrated, cohesive, 
and unitary approach to the semantics
		  of programming/specification 
in the small and in the
		  large.  

The third principle refers to the methodology 
of developing the
		  logical semantics: 

Develop all ingredients (concepts, 
results, etc.) at the highest
		  appropriate level of abstraction}"}

CAFE is the name of a network based environment now under development
		  for supporting systematic creation, checking,
		  verification, and maintenance of formal
		  specifications. CAFE has an algebraic specification
		  language 
called CafeOBJ as its main specification language, and adopts
		  algebraic specification paradigm as its
		  foundation. CafeOBJ is a successor of the OBJ
		  language, and has important new features for
		  concurrency and behavioral 
specifications. Concurrency and behavior are specified based on
		  rewriting logic and behavioral (hidden-sorted)
		  algebra respectively. These new features make it
		  possible to provide powerful language constructs for
		  formal 
object-oriented specifications.

CAFE is designed to be a network based environment. For sharing
		  specification documents systematically over the
		  network, a new document formatting language called
		  Forsdonnet (FORmal Specification Document ON 
NETwork) is designed by extending HTML. Forsdonnet includes constructs
		  for formal and informal specifications, commands for
		  executing (prototyping) and checking/verifying
		  CafeOBJ specifications, etc. Forsdonnet is 
designed to be based on already established standard network
		  infrastructure components like HTML and Netscape. 

This paper gives an overview and design considerations of the CAFE
		  environment, featuring mainly CafeOBJ and Forsdonnet
