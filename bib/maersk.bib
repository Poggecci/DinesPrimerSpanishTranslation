		  This paper deals with a stowage plan for containers

		  that contianers designated for port J must be
		  unloaded and reloaded at port I (before J) in order
		  to access containers below them, designated for port
		  I. This operation is called »shifting…. A
		  container ship calling many ports, may encounter a
		  large number of shifting operations, some of which
		  can be avoided by efficient stowage planning. In
		  general, the stowage plan must also take into

		  planning in order to minimize the number of

		  constraints. First, a 0-1 binary linear programming
		  formulating is presented that can find the optimal
		  solution for stowage in a single rectangular bay of
		  a vessel calling a given number of ports, assuming
		  that the number of constainers to ship is known in

		  using the GAMS software system. It was found,
		  however, that finding the optimal solution using
		  this model is quite limited, because of the large
		  number of binary variables needed for the
		  formulation. For this reason, several alternative
		  heuristic algorithms were developed. The one
		  presented here is based on a »reduced…
		  transportation matrix. Containers with the same
		  source and destination ports are stowed in full
		  stacks as much as possible, and only the remaining
		  containers are allocated by the binary linear
		  programming model. This approach often allows the

		  The efficiency of a maritime container terminal
		  primarily depends on the smooth and orderly process
		  of handling 
containers, especially during the ship's loading process. The stowage
		  and associated loading plans are mainly determined
		  by two criteria: ship stability and the minimum
		  number of container rehandles required. The latter
		  is based 
on the fact that most container ships have a cellular structure and
		  that export containers are piled up in a yard. These 
two basic criteria are often in conflict. This paper is concerned with
		  the ship's container stowage and loading plans that 
satisfy these two criteria. The GM, list and trim are taken into
		  account for the stability measurements. The problem
		  is 
formulated as a multi-objective integer programming. In order to
		  obtain a set of noninferior solutions of the
		  problem, 
the weighting method is employed. A wide variety of numerical
		  experiments demonstrated that solutions by this
		  formulation are useful and applicable in practice.}"}
