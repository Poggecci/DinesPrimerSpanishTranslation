succeeds the study on the syntax and static semantics of
tightly related graphical specification languages for
interlockings. These languages together are known in NS
documents as the Euris method. The Euris method has been
designed by P.\ Middelraad of the Dutch railway company,
NS, de Nederlandse Spoorwegen\footnote{The project we
are involved in we sometimes refer to as ISL:
Interlocking Specification Language.}. It concentrates on a
graphical definition of Railway Interlocking by means of
the so called Logic Sequence Charts, short LSCs, which is
a derivation of the well known Flow Charts. NS have
already developed a symbolic intermediate tool interface
language, IDEAL to automate processing of LSC
specifications. IDEAL, Interlocking Design and
Application Language, is therefore effectively used as an
Interlingua within the Euris-Simulation project. 
A feasibility study of strategies of translations of IDEAL to
the ExSpect simulation specification language is made.
ExSpect, Executable Specification Tool---a formalism
based upon Petri Nets---, would mean a first step toward
proof theoretical correctness of the Euris method. As in
the previous study, we have made use of the Algebraic
Specification Formalism and the Syntax Definition
Formalism which has been integrated in the ASF+SDF
Meta-environment, for this purpose. The major question
addressed is whether it is possible to apply full
automated transformation of manageable complexity of IDEAL
to ExSpect, without losing the LSC operatonal semantics,
and at the same time gain the Petri Net invariants}"}
