	 produced an extensive body of knowledge, but there
	 are four areas in which the  
         foundation of the discipline
	seems weak or obscure: grounding formal 
        representations in reality, implementation bias, control
	of actions, and the role of domain 
        knowledge. This article shines some light in the "four
	dark corners", exposing problems and 
              proposing solutions. We show that all descriptions
	  involved in requirements engineering should be 
    descriptions of the environment. We show that certain
		  control information is necessary for sound 
              requirements engineering, and we explain the close
		  association between domain knowledge and 
      refinement of requirements. Together, these conclusions
		  explain the precise nature of requirements, 
        specifications and domain knowledge, as well as the
		  precise nature of the relationships among 
              them. They establish minimum standards for what
		  information should be represented in a 
      requirements language. They also make it possible to
		  determine exactly what it means for 
              requirements engineering to be successfully
		  completed} \dbkey{formal specification;
