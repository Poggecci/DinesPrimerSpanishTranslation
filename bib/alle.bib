              This textbook is a broad but rigorous survey of the
		  theoretical basis for the 
              design, definition, and implementation of programming
		  languages, and of 
              systems for specifying and proving program
		  behaviour. Both imperative 
              and functional programming are covered, as well as the
		  ways of integrating 
              these aspects into more general languages. Basic
		  concepts and their 
              properties are described with mathematical rigour, but
		  the mathematical 
              development is balanced by numerous examples of
		  applications, particularly 
              of program specification and proof, concurrent
		  programming, functional 
              programming (including the use of continuations and lazy
		  evaluation), and 
              type systems (including subtyping, polymorphism, and
		  modularization). 
              Assuming only knowledge of elementary programming, this
		  text is perfect 
              for advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate courses in
              programming language theory, and will also appeal to
		  researchers and 
              professionals in designing or implementing computer languages.
              \textsf{Reviews:}
              [1] ``The book covers many aspects of computer language, all
		  the time focusing 
              on the fundamental principles. The would-be language
		  designer would profit 
              from studying this text.'' CVU
              [2] ``The coverage is impressive, both for its breadth and
		  for its consistently 
              high quality. the author does an excellent job of
		  making the material as 
              accessible as possible. If you are starting in computer
		  science, then this 
              book should be on your shelves.'' Brian Scattergood.
                [3] ``Each chapter contains valuable exercises and profound
		  bibliographic notes 
              that can serve as a starting point for further
		  reading. I shall use this 
              excellent textbook in my lectures.'' Computing Reviews
              [4] ``This is clearly an important book ? it is thorough and
		  well organized, and 
              the explanations are very clear. I found the technical
		  content to be in almost 
              every respect flawless, and the book seems to be
		  virtually typo-free.'' R. D.

denotational models of software in the process of software design. It is argued
that denotations should be developed in the first place and syntax should be
derived from them. The discussion is carried on an algebraic ground and is
illustrated with an example of developing a model for an OCCAM-like language
with concurrency."}

    This paper presents a formalisation of the IEEE standard for binary
    floating-point arithmetic in Z. The formal specification is refined
    into four components. The procedures presented form the basis for
    the floating-point unit of the Inmos IMS T800 transputer.
    This work resulted in a joint Queen's Award for technological
    achievement for Inmos Ltd. and the Oxford University Computing
    Laboratory in 1990. It is estimated that the approach used saved a
    year in development time compared to traditional methods.}

    logic are given interpretation on a domain of admissible
    computations.  For a given specification the set of admissible
    computations constitute the model.  Using Z one constructs the
    admissible computations i.e., the model.  Using temporal logic one
    specifies the properties.  Thus temporal logic is higher level than
    Z for specifying concurrency.  More importantly, because model
    construction in Z (to a great extent) obscures the niceties of Z
    schema calculus, it is not advisable to use Z for concurrency
    specification.  Actually the use of Z for concurrency description
    has been reported in this paper.}

    specifications.  It is centered around the rigorous development of
    a specification translator with the specifications given in Z, VDM
    and ASL.  Several refinement techniques are used: these range from
    classical VDM development to an original transformational approach
    to implementing from a Z specification.  Advantages and
    disadvantages of the approaches are discussed.  Also, the
    correctness and efficiency of the completed implementation are
    assessed.  The implementation is in an imperative programming
    language and is approximately 10,000 lines long.

    This book contains two rather large (and relatively complete)

    Quite apart from showing that formal specification {\em can} be used
    in AI at the architecture level, the book is intended as a
    case-studies book, and also contains introductory material on Z (for
    AI people).
    \par
    The book assumes a knowledge of Z, so for non-AI people, its primary
    use is for the presentation of the large specifications (the
    blackboard specifications, with explanatory text, is around 100
    pages).}

    a single graphics system, the model lacks flexibility and detail
    when placed in the sphere of may difference graphics systems
    designs, as in the `family of graphics systems' under ISO
    standardisation  at the current time.  An alternative approach is
    needed which provides a sufficient level of detail and flexibility
    to describe both existing graphics systems and possible extensions
    to these which at the same time permits the comparison of graphics
    systems designs in a well defined framework.  The computer graphics
    reference model presented in this paper meets many of these
