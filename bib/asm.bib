% This is the current version of an annotated bibliography  
% of papers which deal with or use ASMs. It is compiled to a
% great extent from references and annotations provided by
% the authors of the listed papers and extends the annotated
% bibliography which previously appeared in \cite{Boerger95a};
% it appear in print as \cite{BoeHug98}.  Comments, additions 
% and corrections are welcome and should be sent to 
% boerger(at)di.unipi.it and huggins(at)acm.org.

% Current updates of this bibliography (as well as somme of
% the papers listed below) will be available on the ASM web
% sites http://www.eecs.umich.edu/gasm and
% http://www.uni-paderborn.de/cs/asm.html. 

% The following principle has been used for defining the
% keys. 

% The key for a paper published in 1945 by a single author)
% Bach is Bach45, i.e. the author's name, where the first
% letter is a capital, followed by the last two digits of
% the year of publication of the paper. The key for a paper
% with two authors, Bach and Beethoven, is BacBee45; if
% there is a third author, Brahms, it is BaBeBr45; with a
% fourth author, Bartok, it becomes BaBeBB45, etc. 

% The order of the references is alphabetical; it is
% chronological within a group of authors. If for a group of
% authors there is more than one paper in the one year 1945,
% these papers receive keys with suffix 45a, 45b, 45c etc.

                  complex systems can be exploited for a reliable and
                  well documented development of executable, but
                  formally inspectable and systematically modifiable
                  code. A hierarchy of stepwise refined abstract
                  machine models is developed, the ground version of
                  which can be checked for whether it faithfully
                  reflects the informally given problem.  The sequence
                  of machine models yields various abstract views of
                  the system, making the various design decisions
                  transparent, and leads to a $C^{++}$ program. This
                  program has been demonstrated during the
                  Dagstuhl-Meeting on Methods for Semantics and
                  Specification, in June 1995, to control the FZI
                  Steam-Boiler simulator satisfactorily. \\ The proofs
                  of properties of the ASM models provide insight into
                  the structure of the system which supports easily
                  maintainable extensions and modifications of both
                  the abstract specification and the implementation.

                  specification and correctness proof for compiling
                  Prolog to WAM \cite {BoeRos95} is extended in
                  modular fashion to the type-constraint logic
                  programming language Protos-L which extends Prolog
                  with polymorphic order-sorted (dynamic) types. In
                  this paper, the notion of types and dynamic type
                  constraints are kept abstract (as constraint) in
                  order to permit applications to different constraint
                  formalisms like Prolog III or CLP(R). The theorem is
                  proved that for every appropriate type-constraint
                  logic programming system L, every compiler to the
                  WAM extension with an abstract notion of types which
                  satisfies the specified conditions, is
                  correct. \cite{BeiBoe96b} extends the specification
                  and the correctness proof to the full Protos

                  linear time badly depends on the computation
                  model. In 1992, Neil Jones designed a couple of
                  computation models where the linear-speed-up theorem
                  fails and linear-time computable functions form 
                  a proper hierarchy. However, the linear time of
                  Jones' models is too restrictive.  Linear-time
                  hierarchy theorems for random access machines and
                  ASMs are proven. In particular it is shown that
                  there exists a sequential ASM {\em U} (an allusion
                  to ``universal'') and a constant {\em c} such that, under
                  honest time counting, {\em U} simulates every other
                  sequential ASM in lock-step with log factor {\em c}. The 
                  generalization for ASMs is harder and more important because
                  of the greater flexibility of the ASM model. One
                  long-term goal of this line or research is to prove
                  linear lower bounds for linear time problems.

                  Sharpens the refinement method of
                  \cite{BoeRos95} to cope also with parallelism and
                  non determinism for an imperative programming
                  language. The paper provides a mathematical definition
                  of the Transputer Instruction Set architecture for
                  executing Occam together with a correctness proof
                  for a general compilation schema of Occam programs
                  into Transputer code. \smallskip \\ 
                  Starting from the Occam model developed 
                  in \cite{BoDuRo94}, constituted by an
                  abstract processor running a high and a low priority
                  queue of Occam processes (which formalizes the
                  semantics of Occam at the abstraction level of
                  atomic Occam instructions), increasingly more
                  refined levels of Transputer semantics are
                  developed, proving correctness (and when possible
                  also completeness) for each refinement step. \smallskip \\
                  Along the way proof assumptions are collected, thus
                  obtaining a set of natural conditions for compiler
                  correctness, so that the proof is applicable to a
                  large class of compilers. 
                  The formalization of the Transputer
                  instruction set architecture has been the 
                  starting point for
                  applications of the ASM refinement
                  method to the modeling of other architectures (see
                  \cite{BoeDel95,BoeMaz97})."

                  unfolding transformations for macros are
                  defined. Next a simple transformation to flatten

                  For all transformations the operational equivalence
                  of the resulting ASMs with the original ASMs is
