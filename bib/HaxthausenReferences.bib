%                  has been designed to supersede many existing
%                  algebraic specification languages and provide a
%                  standard. \CASL consists of several layers,
%                  including basic (unstructured) specifications,
%                  structured specifications and architectural
%                  specifications (the latter are used to prescribe the
%                  structure of implementations).
%
%                  We describe an simplified version of the \CASL
%                  syntax, semantics and proof calculus at each of
%                  these three layers and state the corresponding
%                  soundness and completeness theorems. The layers are
%                  orthogonal in the sense that the semantics of a
%                  given layer uses that of the previous layer as a
%                  ``black box'', and similarly for the proof
%                  calculi. In particular, this means that \CASL can
%                  easily be adapted to other logical systems."

abstract="State-of-the-art railway interlocking systems typically
adhere to the product line paradigm, where each individual system is
obtained by instantiating a generic system with configuration data. In
this paper, we present a domain-specific language, IDL, for specifying
generic behavioural models and generic properties of interlocking
systems. An IDL specification of a generic model consists of generic
variable declarations and generic transition rules, and generic
properties are generic state invariants. Generic models and generic
properties can be instantiated with configuration data. This results
in concrete models and concrete properties that can be used as input
for a model checker to formally verify that the system model satisfies
desired state invariants. The language and a configuration data
instantiator based on the semantics have been implemented as
components of the RobustRailS tool set for formal specification and
verification of interlocking systems. They have successfully been
applied to (1) define a generic model and generic safety properties
for the new Danish interlocking systems and to (2) instantiate these
generic artefacts for real-world stations and lines in Denmark. A
novelty of this work is to provide a domain-specific language for
generic models and an instantiator tool taking not only configuration
data but also a generic model as input instead of using a hard-coded
generator for instantiating only one fixed generic model and its
properties with configuration data.",

title="Safety Interlocking as a Distributed Mutual Exclusion Problem",

pages="52--66",
abstract="In several large scale systems (e.g. robotic plants or transportation systems) safety is guaranteed by granting to some process or physical object an exclusive access to a particular set of physical areas or objects before starting its own action: some mechanism should in this case interlock the action of the former with the availability of the latter. A typical example is the railway interlocking problem, in which a train is granted the authorisation to move only if the tracks in front of the train are free. Although centralised control solutions have been implemented since decades, the current quest for autonomy and the possibility of distributing computational elements without wired connection for communication or energy supply has raised the interest in distributed solutions, that have to take into account the physical topology of the controlled areas and guarantee the same level of safety. In this paper the interlocking problem is formalised as a particular class of distributed mutual exclusion problems, addressing simultaneous locking of a pool of distributed objects, focusing on the formalisation and verification of the required safety properties. A family of distributed algorithms solving this problem is envisioned, with variants related to where the data defining the pool's topology reside, and to how such data rules the communication between nodes. The different variants are exemplified with references to different distributed railway interlocking algorithms proposed in the literature. A final discussion is devoted to the steps needed to convert the proposed definitions into a generic plug-and-play safety-certified solution.",

abstract = "This paper considers the challenge of validating railway timetables and investigates how formal methods can be used for that. The paper presents a re-configurable, formal model which can be configured with a timetable for a railway network, properties of that network, and various timetabling parameters (such as station and line capacities, headways, and minimum running times) constraining the allowed train behaviour. The formal model describes the system behaviour of trains driving according to the given railway timetable. Model checking can then be used to check that driving according to the timetable does not lead to illegal system states. The method has successfully been applied to a real world case study: a time table for12 trains at N{\ae}rumbanen in Denmark.",

abstract = "This paper considers the challenge of designing and
verifying control protocols for geographically distributed railway
interlocking systems. It describes how this challenge can be tackled
by stepwise development and model checking of state transition system
models in a new extension of the RAISE Specification Language. Railway
interlocking systems are reconfigurable systems which can be
configured by supplying data describing the network to be controlled
and other details. Therefore, such systems are natural candidates for
being modelled by generic state transition systems, which abstract
away from the concrete configuration at the time of modelling, and can
later be instantiated with concrete data. For a real-world case study,
a generic state transition system is developed in steps, starting with
an abstract model of the essential system behaviour and incrementally
adding details and restrictions. The stepwise development method
allows different variants of the control protocol to be explored. The
generic models are instantiated with concrete configuration data,
after which desired properties, in particular safety properties, of
the system models are verified using model checking.",
