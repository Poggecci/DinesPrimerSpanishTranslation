		  message sequence charts (MSCs) are widely used in
		  industry 
to document the interworking of processes or objects, they
are expressively quite weak, being based on the modest semantic
notion of a partial ordering of events as defined, e.g., in the
CCITT standard. A highly expressive and rigorously defined
MSC language is a must for serious, semantically meaningful tool
support for use-cases and scenarios. It is also a prerequisite to
addressing what we regard as one of the central problems in
behavioral specification of systems: relating scenario-based
inter-object specification to state-machine intra-object
specification. This paper proposes an extension of MSCs, which
we call live sequence charts (or LSCs), since one of our
main extensions deals with specifying ``liveness", i.e., things that must
occur. In fact, LSCs allow the distinction between possible and necessary
behavior both globally, on the level of an entire chart and locally, when
specifying events, conditions and progress over time within a chart.
We also deal with subcharts, synchronization, branching and iteration. }}
