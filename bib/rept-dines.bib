its stages and steps producing descriptions which can be 
viewed as syntactic documents  (as is done by
management) or as semantic documents (as is done by 
programmers). On the basis of the above notions
 we outline our approach to software engineering
which we see as  consisting of domain engineering, 
requirements engineering and software design. We define and 
describe these stages of software development: their 
acquisition, modelling and  analysis parts (as in
domain and requirements engineering), and the software 
architecture, program organisation and program refinement 
parts of software design. We briefly outline these stages 
and their focus on descriptions, both in the form of informal 
narratives and formal specifications. Formal specifications 
may then be subjected to a spectrum of analysis: from
systematic via rigorous to formal. We then outline and discuss 
the consequences for a modern software engineering
