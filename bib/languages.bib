		  on Document Engineering (DocEng 2003), is the third
		  in a series of international conferences dedicated
		  to research addressing the theory, design,
		  development, and evaluation of computer systems that
		  support the creation, analysis, distribution, and
		  interaction with documents in any medium. Although
		  the series began three years ago, it takes its roots
		  from the tradition of several conferences, including
		  the long series of biennial Electronic Publishing
		  (EP) conferences and Principles of Document
		  Processing workshops, the 2000 Digital Documents and
		  Electronic Publishing conference, the 1988 ACM
		  Conference on Documents Processing Systems, and the
		  1981 ACM Symposium on Text Manipulation. All those
		  conferences contributed to the very notion of
		  document, to be taken in the wide sense of printable
		  and interactively "tangible" composite multimedia
		  information. The DocEng symposium entered the third
		  millennium encompassing a new vision of documents;
		  they are currently at the heart of globally
		  interconnected systems that store information drawn
		  from many media and deliver that information as
		  active documents that adapt to the needs of their
		  users.Research in the area is going on both in
		  academic institutions and industrial
		  laboratories. As an ultimate consequence, document
		  technologies like XML are having a profound impact
		  on data modeling in general because of the way they
		  bridge and integrate a variety of paradigms
		  (database, knowledge representation, and structured
		  document). Previous editions of the symposium,
		  DocEng 2001 -- held in Atlanta -- and DocEng 2002 --
		  held in Mc Lean -- joined the ACM Conference on
		  Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM). In 2003,
		  the symposium takes place, for the first time, in
		  Europe -- Grenoble, France -- and, clearly indicates a
		  growing interest from researchers drawn from various
		  communities and from many continents. We received 81
		  full paper and 43 short paper submissions. As the
		  short paper round took place after the long paper
		  one, authors of rejected papers have had time to
		  prepare a short version of their papers...but in
		  fact most of the 43 short papers were completely new
		  submissions. With the help of 32 reviewers we
		  decided to accept 22 long papers and 12 short
		  papers. These papers have been selected through a
		  rigorous peer review proces.The topics of this
		  year's program demonstrate the wide range of
		  important research topics in document
		  engineering. Indeed, while basic XML technology is
		  well understood and widely adopted, new challenges
		  are arising in areas ranging from document analysis,
		  access and transformation to tools for editing,
		  presenting and managing multimedia documents}"}

		  on par for complete coverage and excels as coverage
		  becomes sparser. In contrast to eager evaluation,
		  lazy evaluation also admits infinite intermediate
		  results, thus extending the design space for
		  transformation sequences.To demonstrate that lazy
		  evaluation preserves the semantics of XSLT, we
		  reduce XSLT to the lambda calculus via a functional

This paper describes an implementation for syntax-directed

		  a semi-automatic transformation is possible.The
		  system generates semi-automatically a transformation
		  between two structures of the same document
		  class. The system gets source and target DTDs as an
		  input. There is a tool for a user to define a label
		  association between the elements of the DTDs. From
		  the two DTDs and from the label association, the
		  system generates the transformation specification
		  semi-automatically. The system has a tool to help
		  the user to select a correct translation if the
		  target DTD produces several possible
		  structures.Implementation of the transformation is
		  based on the top-down tree transducer. From the
		  transformation specification the system produces an

This book is a self-contained presentation of the Larch methodology
and of specific Larch languages for specifying C and Modula-3
interfaces.  Written for practicing programmers and students, it
includes both tutorial and advanced material, illustrated by numerous
examples, including an extensive handbook of Larch Shared Language
specifications.  It also provides information on the publicly
available tools that support the methodology and the languages,
including LP, a powerful tool for reasoning about specifications.

abstract="Hybrid and cyberphysical systems pose significant challenges
for a formal development formalism based on pure discrete events. This
paper compares the capabilities of (conventional) Event-B for
modelling such systems with the corresponding capabilities of the
Hybrid Event-B formalism, whose design was intended expressly for such
systems. We do the comparison in the context of a simple water tank
example, in which filling and emptying take place at different rates,
necessitating a control strategy to ensure that the safety invariants
are maintained. The comparative case study is followed by a general
discussion of issues in which the two approaches reveal different
strengths and weaknesses. It is seen that restricting to Event-B means
handling many more things at the meta level, i.e. by the user, than is
the case with its Hybrid counterpart.",
