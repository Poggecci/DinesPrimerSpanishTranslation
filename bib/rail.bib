we present the syntax and static semantics of IDEAL in
ASF+SDF, an algebraic specification formalism. Several
improvements of IDEAL are suggested."}

succeeds the study on the syntax and static semantics of
tightly related graphical specification languages for
interlockings. These languages together are known in NS
documents as the Euris method. The Euris method has been
designed by P.\ Middelraad of the Dutch railway company,
NS, de Nederlandse Spoorwegen\footnote{The project we
are involved in we sometimes refer to as ISL:
Interlocking Specification Language.}. It concentrates on a
graphical definition of Railway Interlocking by means of
the so called Logic Sequence Charts, short LSCs, which is
a derivation of the well known Flow Charts. NS have
already developed a symbolic intermediate tool interface
language, IDEAL to automate processing of LSC
specifications. IDEAL, Interlocking Design and
Application Language, is therefore effectively used as an
Interlingua within the Euris-Simulation project. 
A feasibility study of strategies of translations of IDEAL to
the ExSpect simulation specification language is made.
ExSpect, Executable Specification Tool---a formalism
based upon Petri Nets---, would mean a first step toward
proof theoretical correctness of the Euris method. As in
the previous study, we have made use of the Algebraic
Specification Formalism and the Syntax Definition
Formalism which has been integrated in the ASF+SDF
Meta-environment, for this purpose. The major question
addressed is whether it is possible to apply full
automated transformation of manageable complexity of IDEAL
to ExSpect, without losing the LSC operatonal semantics,
and at the same time gain the Petri Net invariants."}

This paper describes a study on simulating and analyzing

ExSpect is a toolkit based on the theory of coloured Petri
nets. An approach to translating ISL to ExSpect is suggested.
Experimental results of simulating and analyzing part of
an ISL specification in ExSpect are discussed. ExSpect
seems to be useful for simulating and analyzing ISL
specifications. Furthermore, several interesting topics
for future research are identified."}

At the Dutch station Hoorn-Kersenboogerd, computer
equipment is used for the safe and in time movement of
trains. The computer equipment can be divided in two
layers. A top layer offering an interface and means to
help a human operator in scheduling train movement. And a
bottom layer which checks whether commands issued by the
top layer can safely be executed by the rail hardware and
which acts appropriately on detection of a hazardous
situation. The bottom layer is implemented with a
programmable piece of equipment namely a Vital Processor
Interlocking\footnote{VPI and Vital Processor
Interlocking are registered trademarks of the General
Railway Signal Company.}{\it (VPI)}. This paper introduces the
most important features of the {\it VPI} at Hoorn-Kersenboogerd.
This particular {\it VPI} is modelled in {\it uCRL}. Furthermore, the
paper touches upon correctness criteria and tool support
for {\it VPI}s, and suggests ways for verification of properties
of {\it VPI}s. Experiments show that it is indeed possible to
efficiently verify these correctness criteria."}
