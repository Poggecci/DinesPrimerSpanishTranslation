  abstract      = {Computer graphics systems have traditionally been
                  described in terms of a conceptual model of the so-called
                  `graphics processing pipeline'. This model explains the
                  relationship between graphics information defined by an
                  application and the realization of that information on a
                  display in terms of a sequence of transformation stages.
                  Although adequate for giving an outline of a single
                  graphics system, the model lacks flexibility and detail
                  when placed in the sphere of may difference graphics
                  systems designs, as in the `family of graphics systems'
                  under ISO standardization at the current time. An
                  alternative approach is needed which provides a sufficient
                  level of detail and flexibility to describe both existing
                  graphics systems and possible extensions to these which at
                  the same time permits the comparison of graphics systems
                  designs in a well defined framework. The computer graphics
                  reference model presented in this paper meets many of these
                  objectives.}

                  design methods (OOMs) in the software development industry
                  can be attributed to the support they give to some of the
                  more significant software engineering principles, for
                  example, separation of concerns and generality. On the
                  other hand, most OOMs, like their structured analysis and
                  design predecessors, produce models that are not amenable
                  to rigorous semantic analyses. This problem can be
                  attributed to the lack of firm semantic bases for the
                  modeling notations and concepts. In this paper we show how
                  a particular OOM, the Fusion analysis method, can be made
                  more formal while preserving its essential qualities. Our
                  approach involves integrating the Z formal specification
                  style with the Fusion method. The result is an OOM that
                  produces semantically analyzable Fusion models of behavior
                  at the requirements level.},

                  Operational Semantics (SOS) allows the user to invent
                  appropriate operations to improve abstraction and
                  readability. This is in contrast to traditional
                  specification languages, where the set of operations is
                  fixed. An efficient algorithm, described in [10], uses
                  binary decision diagrams (BDDs) to verify properties of
                  finite specifications written in a Protean language and
                  provides the basis for a model checker we have developed.
                  This paper provides a synthesis of our work on Protean
                  languages and relates the work to other specification
                  techniques. We show how abstraction and refinement in the
                  Protean framework can improve the effectiveness of model
                  checking. We rewrite and verify properties of an existing Z
                  specification by defining suitable operations. We also show
                  how a Protean language can be used to model restricted I/O
                  automata, action refinement, and 1-safe and k-bounded Petri
                  nets.},

                  interaction through operation composition. Experience with
                  using Object-Z to design a range of object-oriented systems
                  has suggested that four composition operators -
                  conjunction, parallel, choice and sequential composition -
                  are necessary and, at least for commonly occurring
                  architectures, sufficient. In this paper, an abstract model
                  of operations in object-oriented systems is first developed
                  and used as the basis for defining the formal semantics of
                  these composition operators.},

  abstract      = {Structured Analysis (SA) is a widely-used software
                  development method. SA specifications are based on Data mow
                  Diagrams (DFD's), Data Dictionaries (DD's) and Process
                  Specifications (P-Specs). As used in practice, SA
                  specifications are not formal. Seemingly orthogonal
                  approaches to specifications are those using formal,
                  object-based, abstract model specification languages, e.g.,
                  VDM, Z, Larch/C++ and SPECS. These languages support
                  object-based software development in that they are designed
                  to specify abstract data types (ADT's). We suggest
                  formalizing SA specifications by: (i) formally specifying
                  flow value types as ADT's in DD's, (ii) formally specifying
                  P-Specs using both the assertional style of the
                  aforementioned specification languages and ADT operations
                  defined in DD's, and (iii) adopting a formal semantics for
                  DFD ''execution steps''. The resulting formalized SA
                  specifications, DFD-SPECS, are well-suited to the
                  specification of distributed or concurrent systems. We
                  provide an example DFD-SPEC for a client-server system with
                  a replicated server. When synthesized with our recent
                  results in the direct execution of formal, model-based
                  specifications, DFD-SPECS will also support the direct
                  execution of specifications of concurrent or distributed
                  systems.},

                  systems expressed using the Z notation, A case memory
                  system is an essential part of any case-based reasoning
                  system, and provides a mechanism for storing old cases, and
                  for assessing the relationship between the stored cases and
                  a new problem, Using the model, characteristics that have
                  been claimed for specific case memory systems in the
                  literature, e.g. responsiveness to a reasoner's goals or
                  use of past experience in case assessment, are expressed
                  formally in terms of constraints on the means by which case
                  relations are computed, The model supports precise
                  reasoning about the characteristics of specific systems and
                  offers insight into the variety of options available to
                  software or knowledge engineers seeking to reuse a case
                  memory system, to select a case memory system shell or to
                  develop a new system.}

  abstract      = {The Z specification language is gaining wide acceptance in
                  both academia and industry as a software development tool.
                  Although there is now a large body of experience in using Z
                  for software development, it is clear that the application
                  areas of Z need not be limited to software alone. Formal
                  design strategies could prove very beneficial in the design
                  of hardware systems, particularly in the areas of
                  requirements analysis and specification at an abstract
                  level. The paper presents an experiment in using Z in the
                  development of a hardware system, giving part of the
                  specification as example and showing how it was used to
                  verify certain aspects of the hardware's behaviour. The
                  refinement process from the abstract specification
                  statements into realised hardware and programmable logic
                  are also shown, concluding with a discussion of the merits
                  of an abstract specification using Z in the context of
                  hardware design.},

  abstract      = {A denotational semantics of a programming language
                  specifies the meaning of the language in terms of
                  well-defined mathematical structures. To this end,
                  state-based formal specification notations such as VDM and
                  Z can be used to specify denotational semantics by defining
                  the transition from language constructs into mathematical
                  entities. However, when using such notations, the abstract
                  syntax, static semantics and dynamic semantics are
                  typically defined separately using distinct formal
                  structures. As a consequence, adding a new construct to the
                  language usually requires modification of each of the above
                  structures. Furthermore, this traditional denotational
                  semantic style generally has limited modularity and
                  reusability. This paper advocates the use of the Object-Z
                  notation to give an object-oriented specification of
                  programming language semantics. With this approach,
                  programming language constructs, such as expressions and
                  statements, are viewed as objects, with the result that the
                  abstract syntax, static and dynamic semantics of individual

  abstract      = {The importance of formalising the specification of
                  standards has been recognised for a number of years. This
                  paper advocates the use of the formal specification
                  language Object-Z in the definition of standards. Object-Z
                  is an extension to the Z language specifically to
                  facilitate specification in an object- oriented style.
                  First, the syntax and semantics of Object-Z are described
                  informally. Then the use of Object-Z in formalising
                  standards is demonstrated by presenting a case study based
                  on the ODP Trader. Finally, a formal semantics is
                  introduced that suggests an approach to the standardisation
                  of Object-Z itself. Because standards are typically large
                  complex systems, the extra structuring afforded by the
                  Object-Z class construct and operation expressions enables
                  the various hierarchical relationships and the
                  communication between objects in a system to be succinctly
                  specified.},

                  specifications given in Z, VDM and ASL. Several refinement

                  implementing from a Z specification. Advantages and

                  programming language and is approximately 10,000 lines

                  logicians to describe agents and the informal vocabulary
                  used by people who actually build robotic agents. In an
                  effort to help bridge the gap, this paper applies
                  techniques borrowed from the field of formal software
                  methods to develop a common vocabulary. Terms useful for
                  discussing agents are given formal definitions. A framework
                  for describing agents, tasks and environments is developed
                  using the Z specification language. The terms successful,
                  capable, perceptive, predictive, interpretive, rational and
                  sound are then defined relative to this framework. The aims
                  of this paper are to develop a precise, common vocabulary
                  for discussing agents and to provide a basis for rational
                  design of agents.},

                  modularization. \par Divided into four sections, the first
                  provides tutorial examples of specifications, the second is
                  devoted to the area of software engineering, the third
                  covers distributed computing, analyzing the role of
                  mathematical specification, and the fourth part covers the
                  IBM CICS transaction processing system. Appendices include
                  comprehensive glossaries of the Z mathematical and schema
                  notation. The book will be of interest to the professional
                  software engineer involved in designing and specifying

                  processing in order to support Long-Lived Transactions

                  simple atomic transactions. Such a system creates problems

                  is a logging algorithm which performs generational garbage
                  collection on the log, thus optimising disk space usage.
                  Its claimed advantage over traditional loggers is most
                  marked in a situation where there are a few long
                  transactions amongst many short ones. This paper describes
                  the formal specification of a transactional logger based on
                  the EL algorithm, its modelling using Object-oriented
                  design(OMT) and implementation. The application of the EL
                  logger to new, emerging applications is also considered. At
                  present the published performance data for this algorithm
                  have been derived using a simulator. This report attempts
                  to examine and scrutinise those results, and asks whether
                  EL could be the logging method of choice in systems that
                  support LLTs.},

  abstract      = {This paper presents a formal specification in the Z
                  notation for a safety-critical control system. It describes
                  a particular medical device but is quite generic and should
                  be widely applicable. The specification emphasizes safety
                  interlocking and other discontinuous features that are not
                  considered in classical control theory. A method for
                  calculating interlock conditions for particular operations
                  from system safety assertions is proposed; it is similar to
                  ordinary Z precondition calculation, but usually results in
                  stronger preconditions. The specification is presented as a
                  partially complete framework that can be edited and filled
                  in with the specific features of a particular control
                  system. Our system is large but the specification is
                  concise. It is built up from components, subsystems,
                  conditions and modes that are developed separately, but
                  also accounts for behaviors that emerge at the system
                  level. The specification illustrates several useful idioms
                  of the Z notation, and demonstrates that an object-
                  oriented specification style can be expressed in ordinary
                  Z.},

                  be applied to the design of a style mechanism for a word
                  processor. The design is cast, along with some expected
                  properties, in a subset of Z. Nitpick checks a property by
                  enumerating all possible cases within some finite bounds,
                  displaying as a counterexample the first case for which the
                  property fails to hold. Unlike animation or execution
                  tools, Nitpick does not require state transitions to be
                  expressed constructively, and unlike theorem provers,
                  Nitpick operates completely automatically without user
                  intervention. Using a variety of reduction mechanisms, it
                  can cover an enormous number of cases in a reasonable time,
                  so that subtle flaws can be rapidly detected.},

  abstract      = {The design of safety-critical user interfaces is typically
                  very different from that of many other applications.
                  Reactor control systems and aircraft cockpits are complex
                  and dynamic, open to input from many different users and
                  devices. A number of formal notations, including Z and
                  temporal logic, have been developed to address these
                  problems. They provide precise and concise means of
                  representing a potential design before designers incur the
                  expense of implementation. Consequently, government bodies
                  and commercial organizations have recommended that these
                  techniques be used when tendering for their contracts.
                  However, there are a number of limitations that restrict
                  the use of mathematical specifications for interface
                  development in large scale projects. In particular, formal
                  notations cannot easily be used to coordinate the
                  activities of human factors and systems engineering teams.
                  This creates particular difficulties if some group members
                  have only a limited understanding of discrete mathematics.
                  A further problem is that the development of a
                  safety-critical application may take many months, or even
                  years, to complete. This creates difficulties because
                  abstract mathematical specifications cannot be used easily
                  by new members of a development team to understand past
                  design decisions. To avoid these limitations I have
                  developed a literate approach to interface specification.
                  This technique uses a formal development language and a
                  semiformal design rationale to support the design of
                  safety-critical user interfaces.},

                  JSDZ) to producing Z specifications from Jackson system
                  development (JSD) specifications automatically. In JSDZ,
                  JSP is to serve as the structuring mechanism to help the
                  analysis of problem domains, and Z is to express the formal
                  specifications of JSD artifacts. Several criteria are
                  identified for comparing specifications generated from JSDZ
                  and Z. The bringing together of diagrammatical and text
                  elements of JSD specifications in Z notations offers two
                  major benefits. First, JSD can be seen both as a
                  structuring mechanism that helps in deriving Z
                  specifications, and as a preliminary that assists in
                  ascertaining the clients requirements. Second, Z
                  specifications make it easier to identify omissions or
                  errors.},

                  language Z often make use of a form of decomposition that
                  is novel to programmers. A published Z specification is
                  rewritten using the form of decomposition familiar to
                  programmers. Whenever decomposition is used, there must be
                  some strategy for deciding what is to go in one component
                  and what is to go in another. At the highest level, the
                  strategy underlying the rewritten specification is the
                  well-known strategy of separating user interface issues
                  from deeper system functionality issues. The effectiveness
                  of the strategy is put to a simple test by showing how a
                  modification to the interface can be supported by a
                  modification to only part of the specification. The
                  conclusions drawn are that care over decomposition is
                  important in specifications, just as it is in programs, and
                  that lessons learned from programming about effective
                  decomposition strategies can be applicable at the
                  specification level, too. In particular, the lesson
                  relearned is that it is important to separate information
                  about a system's functionality from information about how
                  this functionality is presented to users.},

                  been widely used to provide a precise and unambiguous
                  statement of the proposed system as perceived by the
                  developer. However, for many complex specifications,
                  developers cannot themselves be sure about the ``intended
                  behaviour'' of the specification constructed. This paper
                  reports on an approach and toolset that enables a developer
                  to construct a Z specification using the wiZe editor,
                  demonstrate its properties by transforming it into an
                  executable form using the ZAL animation system, and explore
                  its adequacy by animating a variety of scenarios. The
                  application of the approach and toolset is demonstrated on
                  a specification of a telephone network to illustrate that
                  specification validation could be carried our incrementally
                  during development through investigative scenarios to
                  assess the adequacy of the specification. II is claimed
                  that this interaction, when used in peer review or by the
                  individual developer, can provide enhanced accessibility, a
                  better understood and possibly an improved specification.},

                  three promising ways to cope with the increasing size and
                  complexity of today's software systems. Furthermore,
                  effective control of development projects requires the use
                  of versatile metrics for software size and complexity. In
                  this paper, we present a generic formal object-oriented
                  metamodel (GM), specifically tailored for modeling
                  object-oriented software systems, and use it as the
                  foundation for defining two basic measures of structural
                  quality: coupling and cohesion. Even though these two
                  notions are generic, we restrict ourselves to defining them
                  at the class level, which is probably the most useful for
                  object-oriented systems. The metrics have a generic formal
                  definition, which makes them simple, intuitive, and
                  amenable to automated measurement.}

                  constructs the admissible computations i.e., the model.

                  temporal logic is higher level than Z for specifying
                  concurrency. More importantly, because model construction
                  in Z (to a great extent) obscures the niceties of Z schema

  abstract      = {The authors were recently involved in the development of a
                  COBOL parser, specified formally in Z. The type of problem
                  tackled was well suited to a formal language. The
                  specification process was part of a life-cycle
                  characterized by the front- loading of effort in the
                  specification stage and the inclusion of a statistical
                  testing stage. The specification was found to be error
                  dense and difficult to comprehend. The Z was used to
                  specify inappropriate procedural rather than declarative
                  detail. Modularity and style problems in the Z
                  specification made it difficult to review. In this sense,
                  the application of formal methods was not successful.
                  Despite these problems the estimated fault density for the
                  product was 1.3 faults per KLOC, before delivery, which
                  compares favorably with IBM's Cleanroom method. This was
                  achieved, despite the low quality of the Z specification,
                  through meticulous and effort-intensive reviews. However,
                  because the faults were in critical locations, the
                  reliability of the product was assessed to be unacceptably
                  low. This demonstrates the necessity of assessing
                  reliability as well as ``correctness'' during system
                  testing. Overall, the experiences reported in this paper
                  suggest a range of important lessons for anyone
                  contemplating the practical application of formal
                  methods.},

  abstract      = {Z is a widely used, model-oriented specification language.
                  Haskell is a programming language that was recently
                  developed to serve as a standard for non-strict, purely
                  functional languages. Although functional languages have
                  proved to be excellent prototyping tools, Haskell was
                  designed as a general purpose language which could be used
                  when building large software systems.
                  
                  This paper develops two designs for a computerized class
                  roll. The development begins with a description of the
                  requirements and initial specification. The next section
                  delineates the designs and explains how each design targets
                  a specific Haskell data structure: design one employs
                  sequences to model lists, whereas design two uses a Z
                  function to describe a Haskell array. The corresponding
                  implementations follow, along with a critical analysis of
                  each translation from Z notation to flashed code. The paper
                  demonstrates that Z design schemas map well to at least two
                  Haskell data types, namely the list and the array.
                  Furthermore, it includes insights into how software
                  developers might translate similar Z designs to Haskell.},

                  tools, have begun to enjoy more mainstream usage. Assuming
                  that these trends continue, software developers will need
                  improved methods to transform existing specifications into
                  functional implementations. In this paper, we discuss the
                  intermediate specification language FunZ, an integral part
                  of a methodology to produce purely functional programs from
                  Z specifications. To illustrate the concepts of FunZ, we
                  specify the design of a simple software system using both
                  the Z notation and that of FunZ. FunZ itself is best
                  described as an extension of Haskell, yet the language also
                  retains a Z-like flavour in that it contains notational
                  conventions similar to those of standard Z and several
                  object-oriented variants. In addition, software design with
                  FunZ parallels the activity in Z except that each step has
                  functional overtones to better accommodate a final
                  implementation in a purely functional language.},

                  based on continuations. Continuations provide mechanisms
                  for labels and jumps. We present a mechanism to preserve a
                  Prolog program continuation to be invoked at a later point.
                  This mechanism is used in the design of exception signals,
                  handlers, and exception continuations for logic programs.
                  An exception continuation specifies how a computation
                  should continue (e.g. resume, undo, alternate, or
                  terminate) after an exception is raised. Short examples
                  illustrate the difficulty of recovering from error
                  conditions in logic programs using traditional control
                  constructs, and show how easily they can be handled using
                  our approach. The Z notation is used to specify the
                  continuation semantics of logic programs with exceptions.
                  Based on the semantic functions, an interpreter written in
                  Prolog is derived to justify our approach.},

                  introduced. We first define a model for interactive
                  presentations in the Z notation. The model looks at tile
                  presentation from two views: the navigation view and the
                  representation view. The presentation navigation is based
                  on message passing among presentation frames of a
                  presentation, while common information is inherited and
                  shared by frames. The system allows a presenter to plan the
                  audience's reaction in advance. When the audience is
                  watching a presentation, the underlying inference system is
                  learning from his/her responses. This mechanism makes a
                  presentation to be proceeded again act according to the
                  audience's background and knowledge. Thus, the resulting
                  presentation is more diversified. We also propose a
                  multimedia resource database and a number of important
                  resource attributes that we used in the classification of
                  resources. A resource browser is implemented to allow users
                  to preview resources and maintain tile database. The
                  prototype system is implemented under MS Windows. This
                  system can be used for general purpose presentations or
                  demonstrations in different fields such as education,
                  training, product demonstration. and others.},

                  engineers to assure software quality and measure software
                  complexity for many years. However, the complexity metrics
                  of object inheritance hierarchies have not yet been
                  carefully studied. This paper proposes an inheritance
                  level-based metric for measuring the object-oriented
                  software complexity of an inheritance hierarchy. We
                  introduce an algorithm which is proved to be complete and
                  sound to decompose an inheritance hierarchy into a number
                  of measured elements, namely, unit repeated inheritances
                  (URIs). We use the Z specification to model the inheritance
                  hierarchy and describe an inheritance level technique (ILT)
                  based on URIs as a guide to measure the inheritance
                  hierarchy. The proposed metric shows that inheritance has a
                  close relation to object-oriented software complexity. The
                  metric also reveals that overuse of repeated (multiple)
                  inheritance will increase software complexity and thus is
                  prone to implicit software errors. The measurement of
                  inheritance metrics is formed based on the proposed
                  mechanism.},

                  introduced as useful concepts in specification-based
                  testing. The framework can be defined using any model-based
                  specification notation and used to derive tests from
                  model-based specifications-in this paper, it is
                  demonstrated using the Z notation. The framework formally
                  defines test data sets and their relation to the operations
                  in a specification and to other test data sets, providing
                  structure to the testing process. Flexibility is preserved,
                  so that many testing strategies can be used. Important
                  application areas of the framework are discussed, including
                  refinement of test data, regression testing, and test
                  oracles.},

  abstract      = {In medicine, scientific and technological developments for
                  investigation and treatment are proceeding al an ever
                  increasing rate. Protocols for patient management are
                  becoming ever more complicated. Rational design and
                  scientific evaluation of protocols requires precise
                  documentation. We propose a notation based on a series of
                  simple flowcharts which describe procedures in increasing
                  derail. Each step in a flowchart is justified by a reasoned
                  argument, possibly including reference to published
                  articles. General correctness requirements of a protocol
                  include, for example, conformity with known indications and
                  contraindications for investigations and treatments. These
                  correctness requirements can be specified declaratively in
                  mathematical logic and justified by reasoned argument. This
                  makes the correspondence between a protocol and its
                  scientific foundation even more explicit. Flowcharts of
                  this nature are more easily created and modified using a
                  personal computer. Furthermore, use of the computer enables
                  a protocol to be checked automatically against its
                  specification for more rapid identification of errors
                  during development and maintenance of the protocol. We
                  present the structured design of our flowcharting system in
                  the `Z' specification language, and we examine the
                  practicality of our approach by means of a case study: the
                  management of infertility. Our flowcharting system may also
                  have application outside medicine where it is necessary to
                  describe formal protocols for complex procedures.},

                  development of software system using Z and the refinement
                  calculus. The methodology combines the data restructuring
                  capabilities and the codified discrete mathematics of Z
                  with the data encapsulation properties and development
                  style of the refinement calculus, and it aims to provide a
                  formal path from design to implementation without
                  unnecessary transformations of notation or the definition
                  of a new calculus. It is illustrated here by the
                  development of two systems, a simple diary and (part of) a
                  text editor, and is contrasted with the use of Z on its
                  own. We discuss related and future work and conclude with
                  some general comments on applied formal methods.}

                  industrial software development, following to the draft ISO

                  software systems which have been developed so far.
                  Object-oriented methods enable easier development and
                  maintenance of software application systems and promote the
                  reuse of design and program code. Mapping formal
                  specifications into an object-oriented application will
                  therefore give a system that is not only correct and
                  reliable, but easy to develop and enhance. In this paper,
                  we show how specifications containing major decisions that
                  financial managers typically make, can be expressed in the
                  Z notation. These specifications are subsequently
                  translated into pseudo object-oriented programs.},
