                  structured test specifications that describe software

                  ANNotated Ada (Anna) is used as an intermediate language
                  linking the more abstract Z specifications to the concrete
                  Ada program. The method relies on the notion that
                  successive small transformations of a specification are
                  easier to verify than a few large transformations.
                  Essentially the method uses three notations for the
                  representation of the system: an implementation-independent
                  notation for the specification of the system, an
