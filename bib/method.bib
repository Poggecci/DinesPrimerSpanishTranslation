		  A software product is software that is built for
		  nobody in particular but is sold multiple times, and
		  hence typically must be adaptable or customizable. A
		  successful software product will be used for many
		  years, and hence must be able to evolve with
		  changing user demands and environments. We study,
		  amongst others, the conflict between the
		  adaptations made for each customer and the evolution
		  of the kernel of the software product over time. 
As a case study we consider highly customizable enterprise resource
		  planning (ERP) software from Microsoft Dynamics, for
		  which kernel upgrades have traditionally been
		  costly. 
We consider some other well-known software engineering challenges
		  related to the adaptation/evolution conflict. We
		  then present some programming language constructs
		  and software tools that attempt to address these
		  problems, and discuss whether they could be brought
		  to bear on the conflict between adaptation and
		  evolution. Expected published as in Springer

                  use a recent extension of LSCs to handle
                  symbolic instances, allowing an instance
                  to be associated with a class rather than
                  with an object. This allows us to specify
                  scenario-based requirements that could not
                  have been expressed using concrete objects
                  only. This work can form the basis for
                  applying execution, verification and
                  synthesis methods developed for {LSCs}, on a
                  real-world case study.}

The goal of the project is to create an integrated formal method for

		  formal specification languages with those of
		  graphical notations. Formal specification languages
		  provide precise descriptions of domains and
		  requirements and allow properties of such
		  descriptions to be verified by formal
		  proofs. Graphical notations are intuitively
		  understandable and typically offer a hierarchical
		  view of a system that allows major system parts to
		  be easily identified. 

As a preparation for the thesis I wrote a report, \cite{ckm1} in which
		  the syntax 
		  and well--formedness conditions of Message Sequence
		  Charts, Statecharts and Petri Nets are formalised in
		  RSL. The report also presents three examples where a

		  broad, ranging from more theoretically-oriented
		  readers, to those with more practically-oriented
		  interests who need a sound and modern understanding
		  of knowledge representation systems based on
		  Description Logics. The chapters are written by some
		  of the most prominent researchers in the field,
		  introducing the basic technical material before
		  taking the reader to the current state of the
		  subject, and including comprehensive guides to the
		  literature. In sum, the book will serve as a unique

		  today as Fibonacci, was a citizen of Pisa, an active
		  maritime power, with trading outposts on the Barbary
		  Coast and other points in the Muslim Empire. As a
		  youth, Fibonacci was instructed in mathematics in

		  and developed contacts with scientists throughout
		  the Mediterranean world. A member of the academic
		  court around the Emperor Frederick II, Leonardo saw
		  clearly the advantages for both commerce and
		  scholarship of the Hindu positional number system
		  and the algebraic methods developed by al-Khwarizmi
		  and other Muslim scientists. Though it is known as
		  an introduction to the Hindu number system and the
		  algorithms of arithmetic that children now learn in
		  grade school, ``Liber abaci'' is much more: an
		  encyclopaedia of thirteenth-century mathematics,
		  both theoretical and practical. It develops the
		  tools rigorously, establishing them with Euclidean
		  geometric proofs, and then shows how to apply them
		  to all kinds of situations in business and trade -
		  conversion of measures and currency, allocations of
		  profit, computation of interest, alloying of
		  currencies, and so forth. It is rigorous
		  mathematics, well applied, and vividly described. As
		  the first translation into a modern language of the
		  ``Liber Abaci'', this book will be of interest not
		  only to historians of science, but to all
		  mathematicians and mathematics teachers interested
		  in the origins of their methods}}"}

              also met a number of stringent non-functional
		  requirements in areas such as integration, 
              performance and maintenance. The Z notation was used to
		  capture the required function, and the 
              resulting specification was hand-translated into
		  AMN. The B-Toolkit, with project-specific 
              extensions, was then used for the development down to
		  PL/X code. The success of this endeavour 
              is discussed. The use of Z and the B-Method were very
