		  net extended with time; time is in tokens and
		  transitions determine a delay for each produced
		  token. This delay is specified by an upper and lower
		  bound, i.e. an interval. The ITCPN model allows for
		  the modeling of the dynamic behavior of large and
		  complex systems, without loosing the possibility of
		  formal analysis. In addition to the existing
		  analysis techniques for colored Petri nets, we use a
		  new analysis method to analyze the temporal behavior
		  of the net. This method constructs a reduced
		  reachability graph and exploits the fact that delays
		  are described by an interval. We will also discuss

such that automated

designed by P. Middelraad of the Dutch railway company,
NS, de Nederlandse Spoorwegen\footnote{The project we

Interlocking Specification Language.}. It concentrates on a
graphical definition of Railway Interlocking by means of
the so called Logic Sequence Charts, short LSCs, which is
a derivation of the well known Flow Charts. NS have
already developed a symbolic intermediate tool interface
language, IDEAL to automate processing of LSC
specifications. IDEAL, Interlocking Design and
Application Language, is therefore effectively used as an
Interlingua within the Euris-Simulation project. 
A feasibility study of strategies of translations of IDEAL to
the ExSpect simulation specification language is made.
ExSpect, Executable Specification Tool---a formalism
based upon Petri Nets---, would mean a first step toward
proof theoretical correctness of the Euris method. As in
the previous study, we have made use of the Algebraic
Specification Formalism and the Syntax Definition
Formalism which has been integrated in the ASF+SDF
Meta-environment, for this purpose. The major question
addressed is whether it is possible to apply full
automated transformation of manageable complexity of IDEAL
to ExSpect, without losing the LSC operatonal semantics,
and at the same time gain the Petri Net invariants} \PetriNet, \ExSpect"}

 Requirements specification focuses on the 
functionality of the software, but with the
consideration of safety constraints and its 
interaction with the surrounding operational 
environment. The verification of specifications can be
 carried out using three techniques: data flow 
reachability checking, specification, testing, 
and rigorous proofs, respectively. We apply this
 approach to a realistic {\bf railway crossing

transformations and are verified with 
respect to to the graph grammar. Third, 
using a coordination rule as a formal 
specification of a dynamic modification of 
the railway control system, we derive its 
implementation in ConCoord, a programming 
environment for concurrent coordinated programming. 
With regard to software engineering, 
the two first phases belong to the 
system design while the third one forms
the first implementation step.

describes a formal approach to 
requirements specifications for railway 
safety critical software systems and their 
formal safety definitions. Considering the 
programs and the data in a software system 
as the axioms and the inference rules in a 
formal system, we can claim that the system 
is safe if and only if, within the formal 
system, we can prove theorems that are 
equivalent to the safety requirements.
 This approach has many advantages. 
First, a specification is rigorous so that 
any ambiguity may be excluded. Secondly, 
specifications can be compared easily so 
that differences between systems will be 
clearer than in a natural language. 
This would be very useful for confirming
interoperability for two systems. Thirdly, 
there may be systems or methods to 
mechanically convert a formal specification into an
 executable program. These are the reasons 
we started this investigative study. 
Part of an on-going study, this paper looks into the
 research carried out in various places abroad 
and seeks to clarify the underlying principle, 
and in particular its safety requirements. Some
 indications of our possible future studies 
are included. \dbkey{formal specification;

Configuration of the test centre allows simulation

the system checks for new installations as well as for
 reconstructions, internal acceptances and fault 
processing are carried out. System checks consist 
of a function integrity test, detection of
 time response and interface and stress tests. 
By this procedure, faults in the software can 
be detected and corrected before delivery of the
 interlocking. The quality of the product is 
increased and additional costs arising for 
the concerned railway authority at a later 
stage due to limited availability are prevented. 
When interlockings are reconstructed, the new 
data can be prechecked so that the change on 
site can be realized much faster than until now. 
Consequently, operational inconveniences can 
be reduced to a minimum. \dbkey{%

  note =     "\dbabstract{Computers are increasingly being
		  embedded within 
                 safety systems. As a result, a number of accidents have
                 been caused by complex interactions between operator
                 'error' and system 'failure'. Accident reports help to
                 ensure that these 'failures' do not threaten other
                 applications. Unfortunately, a number of usability
                 problems limit the effectiveness of these documents.
                 Each section is, typically, drafted by a different
                 expert; forensic scientists follow metallurgists, human
                 factors experts follow meteorologists. In consequence,
                 it can be difficult for readers to form a coherent
                 account of an accident. This paper argues that fault
                 trees can be used to present a clear and concise
                 overview of major failures. Unfortunately, fault trees
                 have a number of limitations. For instance, they do not
                 represent time. This is significant because temporal
                 properties have a profound impact upon the course of
                 human-computer interaction. Similarly, they do not
                 represent the criticality or severity of a failure. We
                 have, therefore, extended the fault tree notation to
                 represent traces of interaction during major failures.
                 The resulting Accident Fault Tree (AFT) diagrams can be
                 used in conjunction with an official accident report to
                 better visualise the course of an accident. The Clapham
                 Junction railway disaster is used to illustrate our
                 argument}",

                 work on the project for the introduction of the EDI
                 system at the Port of Koper based on the EDIFACT
                 standard and also plans to introduce the EDI
                 transactions through three phases. The Port of Koper
                 has started the project to connect its business
                 partners through the EDI system. The aim of project in
                 the first phase is to communicate messages about work
                 orders (dispozicija) which is the main source of
                 information for the short term planning. The data are
                 collected mainly from shipping agents, forwarding
                 firms, railway companies and trucking companies. Since
                 the Port of Koper is a customs free zone the goods are
                 under strict Customs surveillance so the data must also
                 be available for customs inspection and control. The
                 present state of the international EDIFACT standard is
                 offering some messages to be used for the purpose of
                 planning at the Port of Koper. The most suitable is the
                 IFTMFR(International Forwarding and Transport Message
                 Framework) a message framework consisting of six
                 different messages. The preliminary study has shown
                 that some segments have to be added to the IFTM
                 messages to suit the needs of Port of Koper and ita
                 partners. The CUSDEC (Customs Declaration Message) and
                 CUSRES ( Customs Response Message) messages are also
                 important to this project but the customs documents
                 currently in use in Yugoslavia are not prepared
                 according to those standards\\
The first part of project, which has to be operational
                 by the end of the first quarter of the year 1992, will
                 cover the introduction of the standard message for the
                 data interchange between the Port of Koper and its
                 business partners with all necessary coding and
                 organizational instructions. The system will also cover
                 the feed- back information about work which has been
                 accepted and planned at the Port of Koper. In the next
                 phase of the project, to be commenced after the first
                 phase has started, the EDI system will also cover the
                 information about ships coming and going to the port,
                 work completed and direct data interchange with the
                 railways}",

                 specifications written in Z. PVS is a general theorem
                 prover for a language that consists of higher order
                 logic together with set theory. The review has its
                 focus on the possibility to use these tools in an
                 industrial context. The plan for the review was to get
                 acquainted with the tools on a general level and then
                 to use them to partially validate a formal
                 specification of requirements for the safety function
                 of railway signaling systems. The conclusion is that
                 PVS is clearly superior to Z/EVES. PVS has such a good
                 performance that it can be recommended for industrial
                 use in the area of formal methods. Concerning Z/EVES,

                 between a pair of nodes on a network will often be
                 slight variations of one another. This could be a
                 problem for many path-based models, particularly those
                 on a capacitated networks where different routing
                 alternatives are needed that are less likely to
                 encounter the same capacity constraints. This paper
                 develops a method to solve for k differentiated paths
                 that are relatively short and yet relatively different
                 from one another, but not necessarily disjoint. Our
                 method utilizes the sum of a path's distance plus some
                 fraction of its shared distance with each other path. A
                 minimax algorithm is used to select the path whose

                 environment of the Earth, certain classes of automated
                 control systems in industries such as nuclear power,
                 aviation and railway signalling are subject to
                 independent analysis and certification, before
                 operational use is permitted. Although comparatively
                 small, the UK safety critical control business brings
                 substantial kudos and visibility to those companies
                 with the scientific and engineering skills needed to
                 satisfy the strict demands of the regulatory bodies.
                 The subject is deeply rooted in the technology of
                 so-called 'embedded computer systems'. The techniques
                 which have been developed for the specification, design
                 and verification of such systems are intended to
                 provide a practical route for the development of such
                 highly critical systems, at a cost which is acceptable
                 to the operator of the potentially hazardous plant or
                 vehicle. The results of UK research and development
                 have been a major influence in the derivation of both
                 national and international standards for
                 safety-critical systems. The UK Ministry of Defence is
                 regarded as a leader in these disciplines, with Interim
                 Defence Standards 00-55 and 00-56 being primary inputs
                 to debates in NATO on the safety of flight control and
                 weapons systems. In the civil sector, the UK has been
                 prominent in the derivation of the International
                 Electrotechnical Commission Standards (65A/94 and
                 65A/96) for safety-critical systems, which have been
                 promulgated recently. Unfortunately, these skills in
                 the regulatory regime have not been reflected in any
                 increase in the UK share of the market, for reasons
                 which one dealt with}",

		  systems is 
                 developed, based on distributed discrete event systems.
                 The dependencies between states and events are
                 formulated on a local basis exclusively. Therefore, for
                 developing a model of a component, it is sufficient to
                 consider the component and its direct environment
		  only. This approach allows the 
                 separation of the description of dependencies during
                 the system design process and their reinforcement
                 during the runtime of the system. Consequently, the
                 whole modelling process is simplified. This applies to
                 the initial development, as well as to modifications
                 and extensions of the model. Further, a new algorithm
                 is presented. This so-called Eunomic Algorithm
                 guarantees that the occurrence of controllable events
                 will be permissible always during the runtime of the
                 system. Thus, the previously formulated dependencies
                 are continuously enforced. The
                 data of a railway safety system are divided into
                 different layers of abstraction, so-called domains.
                 Each domain is described with an appropriate modelling
                 language, Petri nets for the dynamic domains, and
                 double point graphs as well as logic invariants for the
                 static domains. For abstract type data and for actual
                 instance data, respectively, specific variants of these
                 domains are developed. The goal of the global system
                 structure is a rigorous separation between the main
                 safety layer and the controlling layer. As a result,
                 the system components with relevance on safety can be
                 simplified and reduced considerably. An example is
                 discussed, which covers the basic functions and
                 properties of a railway safety system. The application
                 of the proposed modelling languages shows that railway
                 safety systems may be described by such a model in a
                 precise, compact manner. Furthermore, their properties
                 can be verified by mathematical means, and
                 simplifications of the system can also be identified
                 from the model}",

                 transit systems are becoming more and more common to
                 improve mobility in large urban areas. The design of
                 such systems is a very critical task which has long
                 term effects on modal aplit. Decisions are to be made
                 about topological configuration, the number and
                 location of lines and stations, line frequencies etc..
                 In this context decision making is a complex job as
                 several players are involved, some objectives are
                 unquantifiable and estimation of the non-inferior
                 solutions set considering the two main quantifiable
                 objectives (e.g. the construction cost and a measure of
                 the social benefit); second, the choice, among the
                 previously selected solutions, of the most suitable
                 configuration by means of the remaining objectives. In
                 the present paper we tackle the first step generalising
                 a k-shortest path technique in such a way to consider
                 complex topological patterns (grids, stars, cartwheels,
                 triangles etc.). The proposed method was used to
                 simulate the Rome metro system}",

\dbabstract{In this paper we consider the problem of finding a
                 feasible routing for one-dimensional transport systems.
                 This problem arises as a subproblem in production
                 planning, when a mono-rail crane with several crabs is
                 part of the production lane. Practical restrictions
                 like finite speed of crabs and a minimal distance
                 between crabs lead to a special routing problem. 
                 We show that this problem corresponds to the geometric
                 problem of covering segments with angle-restricted
                 curves with the additional constraint that all curves
                 have at least distance 1. We prove that this question
                 can be formulated as a shortest path problem.
                 Finally we discuss how the presented algorithm can be
                 used as a module for a greedy-algorithm solving a
                 no-wait scheduling problem}",

                 existing transportation network. The region's primary
                 transportation artery, Interstate 4, is experiencing
                 much of this strain. In order to alleviate the
                 congestion on I-4 and prepare for the future growth of
                 the region, the State of Florida Department of
                 Transportation (District 5) is preparing a
                 comprehensive master plan to guide future improvements
                 to I-4. Alternatives vary in scope from the simple
                 addition of lanes, to the addition of extensive high
                 occupancy vehicle lanes, park and ride facilities, and
                 urban rail systems.\par As alternatives have been

VODIS project is focused on the area of
                 speech-based interfaces to information systems
                 accessible via the public telephone network. The key
                 features of this environment are a highly restricted
                 topic domain, goal oriented dialogue, continuous speech
                 from a small (150 word) vocabulary, naive untrained
                 users and highly variable recognition rates. Our
                 dialogue design strategy has been motivated by two
                 major requirements: (i) to provide a habitable user
                 interface and (ii) to give direct support of the speech
                 recognition process. Our implementation strategy has
                 been to use the frame approach using our special
                 purpose programming language UFL. For (i) we have been
                 guided by two influences. Firstly, we have analyzed
                 real data obtained from transcripts of an existing
                 (human) information service: the British Rail Timetable
                 Enquiry Service. Secondly, we have adopted a formal
                 measure of {"}goodness{"} based on minimisation of
                 transaction time. For (ii), we have developed an
                 adaptive strategy whereby the user responses are
                 syntactically constrained. When recognition is good,
                 user inputs are relatively unconstrained. When
                 performance is poor, questions to the user are made
                 much more specific ultimately to the point where only
                 single word answers are invited and accepted. The
                 purpose of this chapter is to review our overall system
                 design strategy from the point of view of dialogue
                 control and reflect upon the lessons learnt}",

THE ABSTRACT OF THIS ENTRY HAS NOT
                 BEEN VALIDATED. How effective is the horn on trains in alerting
                 motorists, cyclists and pedestrians of the approach of
                 a train to a highway-railroad crossing? Road users
                 become aware of trains approaching crossings either by
                 seeing them, hearing the warning horn or by warning
                 devices at the crossing. Auditory warnings have some
                 advantages over others, but practical problems of sound
                 transmission and the noise environment of road users
                 limit their effectiveness. Factors that affect the
                 audibility of train horns and crossing bells are
                 discussed. Train and crossing bells are generally
                 effective for persons in their immediate environment,
                 but are relatively ineffective for occupants of closed
                 vehicles. Because of the lack of reliability of the
                 detectability of auditory warning signals provided to
                 motorists and others approaching rail-highway
                 crossings, they should visually scan the tracks to
                 ascertain the presence of a train}"

                 pressure has led to the increased use of COTS
                 (commercial off-the-shelf equipment in safety critical
                 systems), making it imperative that we extend proven
                 safety techniques to COTS based systems as well. To
                 this end, we have developed the Vital Framework
                 (V-Frame), which is used to develop a safety critical
                 platform from COTS hardware and software. The key
                 technologies in this framework are formal methods,
                 information redundancy, a proprietary data format, and
                 a concurrent checking scheme. Combining these
                 technologies results in a real time, checkable
                 correctness criterion that is a signature of the
                 application's algorithm structure and is independent of
                 both the hardware and the operating system. V-Frame's
                 most significant attribute is that the fail safe
                 properties of applications do not require the firmware
                 to be correct: the application will operate in a fail
                 safe (or vital) manner even if there are design faults
                 in the operating system and/or the hardware fails. This
                 does not mean that the application does not have to be
                 correctly specified and designed. Formal methods are
                 appropriate in the design of safety critical COTS
                 systems because a generic processing environment is
                 analogous to a formal system: it is designed to apply
                 well defined transformation rules to inputs (7

                 aircraft, construction, and rail and industrial
                 operations. Typical environmental analyses examine each
                 of these sources independently without combining them
                 into one model that would predict the complete
                 acoustical environment in a specific geographic area.
                 Without the capability to combine all potential noise
                 sources, a realistic prediction of a noise environment
                 cannot be achieved. A GIS model has been developed that
                 considers all dominant noise sources and propagation
                 effects to yield contour mapping of a predicted
                 environment including all of these sources

                 locations in the region in which to target marketing

                 analysis was performed by importing several existing
                 data sources into the GIS. These data sources included
                 passenger survey data, census data, and local

Based on a time table that
                   records the train journies of many trains
                   over a rail net of very many stations
                   and with very many paths linking many of
                   these stations, the problem is to
                   [re--]construct the net. Some train
                   journies travel between sequences of two
                   or more neighbouring stations. Other train
                   journies bypass some such neighbouring 
                   stations. The problem is, from the time
                   table only to recognise which are in fact
                   neighbouring stations and which trains are 
                   in fact bypassing some such stations --- and
                   which are not, that is: traveling along
                   ``adjacent'' (``parallel'') paths. Stations
                   are modeled as nodes of a graph. Edges of
                   the graph designate non--stop train trips
                   between pairs of stations. A station
                   from which several paths of length one or 
                   more lead along different rail lines to 
                   different or same (next) stations induce

From a time table which

                  over an unknown rail net the problem to
                  be solved using the techniques of this 
                  paper is that of constructing a rail net
                  graph where nodes designate railway stations
                  and where edges designate rail lines between
                  stations. The problem is tricky in that some
                  train journies may emanate from a station
                  to different stations but along the same
                  linear sequence of lines (ie.

This document shall serve to inform a larger audience of
the goals of the AMORE project as seen from and hopefully
discharged by the Department of Computing Science, the
Technical University of Denmark (DCS/DTU). It sets the
goals for the AMORE part to be handled by DCS/DTU. The 
issue of the present version of this document shall thus also
serve to inform young, aspiring candidates from abroad
Europe (and outside Denmark), pre-- or post PhD researchers
who will work at DCS/DTU as financed by the AMORE grant. 
%
A methodology component of the project is that of correlating 
the hopefully very many and diverse optimisation problems and 
solutions by means of a carefully tuned set of coherent 
\textbf{Abstract Models of Railway Planning \& Handling 
(AMoRPH)}. This Synopsis is about that latter project 
methodological approach as it is ``anchored'' at the Dept.\ 
of Computing Science, The Technical University of Denmark.
%
The present document semi\--formalises such notions as
optimisation, scheduling, allocation, and strategic, tactical
and operational planning before it considers a taxonomy of
railway optimisation issues. The document also exemplifies
a ``tiny'' informal and formal description of the kind that
the AMORE project component AMoRPH will base its further
work on. 
%
These semi and ``full'' formalisations will illustrate the
methodological approach talen by DCS/DTU: formal specification
and (but not illustrated here) formal (and rigourous and 
systematic) verification}
